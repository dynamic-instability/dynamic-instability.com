    <p class="essayTitle"><i>Kafka and His Precursors</i></p>
    <br>
    <p>
        At one time I considered writing a study of Kafka's precursors. 
        I had thought, at first, that he was as unique as the phoenix of rhetorical praise; after spending a little time with him, I felt I could recognize his voice, or his habits, in the texts of various literatures and various ages. 
        I will note a few of them here, in chronological order.
    </p>
    <p class="essay">
        The first is Zeno's paradox against motion. A moving body at point A
        (Aristotle states) will not be able to reach point B, because it must first
        cover half of the distance between the two, and before that, half of the half,
        and before that, half of the half of the half, and so on to infinity; the form of
        this famous problem is precisely that of <i>The Castle</i>, and the moving body
        and the arrow and Achilles are the first Kafkaesque characters in literature.
        In the second text that bibliographic chance brought my way, the affinity is
        not in the form but in the tone. It is a fable by Han Yu, a prose writer of the
        ninth century, and it is found in the admirable <i>Anthologie raisonee de la litterature chinoise</i>
         (1948) by Margoulies. This is the mysterious and tranquil
        paragraph I marked:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        It is universally admitted that the unicorn is a supernatural being and
        one of good omen; thus it is declared in the Odes, in the Annals, in the
        biographies of illustrious men, and in other texts of unquestioned authority. 
        Even the women and children of the common people know
        that the unicorn is a favorable portent. But this animal does not figure
        among the domestic animals, it is not easy to find, it does not lend itself
        to any classification. It is not like the horse or the bull, the wolf or the
        deer. Under such conditions, we could be in the presence of a unicorn
        and not know with certainty that it is one. We know that a given animal
        with a mane is a horse, and that one with horns is a bull. We do not
        know what a unicorn is like.<sup>1</sup>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="essay">
                The third text comes from a more predictable source: the writings of
        Kierkegaard. The mental affinity of both writers is known to everyone; what
        has not yet been emphasized, as far as I know, is that Kierkegaard, like
        Kafka, abounded in religious parables on contemporary and bourgeois
        themes. Lowrie, in his <i>Kierkegaard</i> (Oxford University Press, 1938), men
        tions two. One is the story of a counterfeiter who, under constant surveil
        lance, examines Bank of England notes; in the same way, God could be
        suspicious of Kierkegaard and yet entrust him with a mission precisely be
        cause He knew he was accustomed to evil. Expeditions to the North Pole are
        the subject of the other. Danish clergymen had declared from their pulpits
        that to participate in such expeditions would serve the eternal health of the
        soul. They had to admit, however, that reaching the Pole was difficult and
        perhaps impossible, and that not everyone could undertake the adventure.
        In the end, they announced that any journey-from Denmark to London,
        say, in a steamship, or a Sunday outing in a hackney coach-could be seen
        as a veritable expedition to the North Pole. The fourth prefiguration I
        found in Browning's poem "Fears and Scruples," published in 1876. A man
        has, or thinks he has, a famous friend. He has never seen this friend, and the
        fact is that this friend has never been able to help him, but he knows that
        the friend has very noble qualities, and he shows others the letters his friend
        has written. Some have doubts about his nobility, and handwriting experts
        declare the letters to be fake. In the last line, the man asks: "What if this
        friend happened to be-God?"

                My notes also include two short stories. One is from <i>Histoires desobli
        geantes</i> by Leon Bloy, and refers to the case of some people who amass
        globes, atlases, train schedules, and trunks, and who die without ever hav
        ing left the town where they were born. The other is entitled "Carcassonne"
        and is by Lord Dunsany. An invincible army of warriors departs from an in
        finite castle, subjugates kingdoms and sees monsters and crosses deserts and
        mountains, but never reaches Carcassonne, although they once catch a
        glimpse of it. (This story is, as it is easily noticed, the exact opposite of the
        previous one; in the first, they never leave the city; in the second, they never
        reach it.)

                If I am not mistaken, the heterogenous pieces I have listed resemble
        Kafka; if I am not mistaken, not all of them resemble each other. This last
        fact is what is most significant. Kafka's idiosyncracy is present in each of
        these writings, to a greater or lesser degree, but if Kafka had not written, we
        would not perceive it; that is to say, it would not exist. The poem "Fears and
        Scruples" by Robert Browning prophesies the work of Kafka, but our reading
        of Kafka noticeably refines and diverts our reading of the poem. Browning
        did not read it as we read it now. The word "precursor" is indispensable to
        the vocabulary of criticism, but one must try to purify it from any connotation
        of polemic or rivalry. The fact is that each writer <i>creates</i> his precursors.
        His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future.'
        In this correlation, the identity or plurality of men doesn't matter. The first
        Kafka of "<i>Betrachtung</i>" is less a precursor of the Kafka of the gloomy myths
        and terrifying institutions than is Browning or Lord Dunsany.

    <p class="essayFootnote">
        <sup>1</sup> The failure to recognize the sacred animal and its shameful or casual death at the
        hands of the people are traditional themes in Chinese literature. See the last chapter of
        Jung's <i>Psychologie und Alchemie</i> (Zurich, 1944), which includes two curious illustrations.
